# LAB 3: Asynchronous Callbacks
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LizabethPetersen/03-asyncronous-callbacks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LizabethPetersen/03-asyncronous-callbacks)

##  Documentation
This lab contains a file (reader.js) which uses the Express module called fs to read data files. The fileReader function takes in two parameters (arity of 2) which is the data array or an individual file path and a callback. The callback function has an arity of 2, with error comma data as its form.

The callbacks.js is a practice file from the lab to basically explain the path that callbacks make. It has no functionality otherwise.
